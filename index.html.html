<p><b><u>Studyin In Japan</b></u><br/>
	Studying in Japan has been a dream for many students around the world. 
	High school, University, Undergraduate and Graduate students move to Japanese
	schools either as exchange students or full-time students. The student life 
	is not easy. Students have various challenges even in their home countries. 
	However, coming alone to a foreign land with a different culture, language, 
	and rules might be hard. The multiple differences in Japan are very challenging,
	however, I will give you tips on how to live and survive in Japan.

<p><b><u>About Kyoto</b></u><br/>
	Kyoto City attracts millions of local and international visitors each year 
	looking for traditional Japanese culture. Temples and shrines such as 
	Kiyomizudera Temple and Kinkakuji draw lots off attention from visitors,
	as do the bamboo groves of nearby Arashiyama. Stay in a traditional ryokan,
	take a dip in a rejuvenating onsen, and enjoy the seasonal changes of 
	cherry blossoms and brilliant autumn foliage. Kyoto's magic is only a 
	short bullet train ride from Tokyo. Beyond the city lie Kyoto Prefecture's 
	many attractive rural areas. In the north, Amanohashidate has long been 
	considered one of Japan's three most scenic places. Nestled in the mountains, 
	Miyama is one of the last towns with thatched-roof farmhouses, many of which are 
	still inhabited. Enjoy delicious local vegetables and the famous green tea grown in Uji.
